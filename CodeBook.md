"Subject"

* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment. Values are 1..30. 

"Activity"

* The activity performed by the subject who carried out the experiments. The possible activities are: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING" and "LAYING".


___All of the following variables are averages of selected variables (features) from the
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" for each subject and
activity.___

___The original features selected as a source for this dataset are either the
mean or the standard deviation of the values of a specific variable estimated from the sensor
signals of one subject doing one activity during a single time window.___

___All of the original features are normalized and bounded within [-1, 1], and
hence all of the follwoing variables are unitless and bounded within [-1, 1].___
